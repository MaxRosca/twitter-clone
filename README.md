#Twitter clone

###Idea
As a starting developer I wanted to have a project that I can update constantly with the new stuff that I learn.
The initial project will be a simple api for a twitter-like app using Java, Spring, Hibernate and a MySql Database, 
maybe with some simple user interface. In the future I will update the project with other stuff, such as Spring Boot, 
Docker, maybe try to create a frontend using React. Also, I will try to implement all the principles that I know, such 
as OOP, including design patterns and AOP. If you have any suggestions, improvements or any kind of feedback write an 
email to roscamaxim2002@gmail.com, I will be really happy to receive it and get some help.
